# SafeSteth

The actual pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, or COVID-19, forces ourselves to adapt to new ways of interaction and social communicate. Because of this pandemic we started to use masks on streets and closed spaces, we have to maintain social distancing, and many other restrictions to keep us safe. Besides that, but still caused by COVID-19 pandemic, the auscultation practise become compromised. In order to doctors ensure that they are fully protected and safe dealing with their patients, they need to wear protective and certified clothing. This clothing, to meet all the certification standards, needs to be completelly closed what makes it impossible to have the stethoscope on the doctor's ear.

StethStream is the solution to that problem since it makes possible to a doctor, just having an Android mobile phone and a Littmann Model 3200 with him, to auscultate his patient with his protective clothing. The software is an Android mobile application that handles the bluetooth communication between the stethoscope and the headphones. This bluetooth communication have the contraint of being a classical Bluetooth 2.0 communication since this is the supported communication on the Littmann Model 3200.
